To create a jar (Linux): The basic idea is we need to get the .class files created, then put them into a .jar archive.


First, we need the location of the ImageJ root directory (I will call it $IJ_RT).
Second, go into the directory with the ParticleTracker_.java file; ougth to be .../trunk. (This makes later steps a little easier.)
Third, run the command "javac -classpath $IJ_RT/ij.jar ./ParticleTracker_.java"
(For thoes who know linux "javac -classpath imagejs.jar javacode.java")

The program will compile and finish. It will probably complain about "unsafe operations" or some such.
(Ask the 13 year old; not my problem).

Once compiled there ought to be a bunch of *.class files in ParticleTracker_.java's directory.
We need to put all of these files into a .jar file (jar is little more than tar or zip file storage).
To create the jar we run the command "jar cf ParticleTracker_.jar *.class" (From the ParticleTracker trunk directory.)
(For thoes who know linux "jar cf archive_name.jar files_to_be_archived")

That it; just "throw" the .jar file into the ImageJ plug-in directory and you are good to go.
